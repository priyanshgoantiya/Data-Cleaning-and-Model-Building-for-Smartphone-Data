# Data-Cleaning-and-Model-Building-for-Smartphone-Data
Objective:
The goal of this project is to clean and preprocess a smartphone dataset to ensure its quality for analysis and model building. After cleaning the data, the next step is to build a predictive model to understand key patterns and relationships within the dataset. This could include predicting factors like price, brand preference, or other features based on the cleaned data.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Tools:
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy: For numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Scikit-learn: For model building and evaluation
Jupyter Notebook: For writing and executing code interactively
